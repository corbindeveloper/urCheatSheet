### Side Container Needs to be fixed and 100vh
Will have to  sort out the width when sorting querys 

### Need to look into possible having a dynamic show and hide systems
** IMPORTANT  **
- This would enable approximately 3 pages to manage the entire site. The difficult part comes with how to show which link we are actively we on while also showing the correct  html and hiding the correct.
- ** This may be something for post dojo grad. **

### Look into various css animated backgrounds
- Need something a little cleaner while maintaining the fun. 

### Learn more link'
** IMPORTANT **
- Needs to be style with an interactive arrow or something of that nature.
- Will have to be resized at every query
- Without hard set width it's taking up the whole line and the hover isn't properly working.

## Transitions/Animations
- Have the content ease-in after the slide bar 

## Contribute button
- Needs to be made responsive
